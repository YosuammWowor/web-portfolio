# Web Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built for learning and experimenting with front-end web development.  
The site is currently a **work in progress**, created for **educational purposes** only.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **HTML** ‚Äì for structuring the web content
- **CSS** ‚Äì for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** ‚Äì mainly used with the **jQuery** library to manipulate DOM elements and add animations
- **Bootstrap** ‚Äì as the front-end framework for responsive design and UI components
- **jQuery** ‚Äì for simplifying JavaScript interactions, animations, and event handling

## üìö Purpose

This project serves as:

- A personal portfolio to display my projects (in progress)
- A sandbox for studying and testing web technologies like Bootstrap and jQuery
- A foundation to improve and build a more complete version in the future
